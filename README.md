# UpdateSuppressor
Temporarily suppresses the 3ds update nag.

Pick the app who's update you want blocked using the HBmenu title selector.

Program will automatically exit if all goes well.

Placing an empty file named `halt` in the same folder as the program will override this, as well as asking for confirmation before deleting the version record.
